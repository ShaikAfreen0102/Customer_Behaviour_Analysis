📊 Customer Behaviour Analysis

A comprehensive Data Analytics project focused on understanding customer behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. This project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow—from data loading and cleaning to visualization and insights generation—designed for business decision-making.

🧠 Overview

Customer behavior analysis helps organizations understand purchasing patterns, preferences, and trends.
In this project, we analyze a customer dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), store and query data using SQL, and visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The final insights are presented through a structured report and PPT.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning, EDA, and analysis

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL – Data storage and querying

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI – Interactive dashboards & visual analytics

Gamma – Report & PPT creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment
